#### A Safer Way 

Using the default Int or UInt types allows overflow and underflow errors to occur silently, without notice. These incorrect values propagate and such errors are difficult to recognize after the fact.

This package exports safer versions. These types check for _overflow and underflow_ in each of the basic arithmetic functions. The processing will stop with a message in the event of _overflow or underflow_.  On one machine, the overhead relative to the built-in integer types is <= 1.2x.

#### Background

Integer overflow occurs when an integer type is increased beyond its maximum value. Integer underflow occurs when an integer type is decreased below its minimum value.  Signed and Unsigned values are subject to overflow and underflow.  With Julia, you can see the rollover using Int or UInt types:
   ```julia
   typemax(Int) + one(Int) < 0
   typemin(Int) - one(Int) > 0
   typemax(UInt) + one(UInt) == typemin(UInt)
   typemin(UInt) - one(UInt) == typemax(UInt)
   ```
There are security implications for integer overflow in certain situations.
```julia
 for i in 1:a
    secure(biohazard[i])
 end
 
 a = Int16(456) * Int16(567)
 a == -3592
 # the for loop does not execute
```

## Highlights

### Why Does This Package Exist?

- Your work may require that integer calculations be secure, well-behaved or unsurprising.

- Your clients may expect your package/app/product calculates with care and correctness.

- Your software may become part of a system on which the health or assets of others depends.

- Your prefer to publish research results that are free of error, and you work with integers.

### What Does This Package Offer?

- _SaferIntegers_ let you work more cleanly and always alerts otherwise silent problems.

- This package is designed for easy use and written to be performant in many sorts of use.

- All exported types are stable (e.g. `typeof(SafeInt32 + 1) == SafeInt32`)

- Using _SaferIntegers_ can preclude some known ways that insecure systems are breached.

- Safer Rationals just work: `SafeRational(161803398875,100000000000)`

### Test code for integer safety

- `@saferintegers include(join("PackageTestDirectory", "PackageTests.jl"))`
    - includes a type modified `PackageTests.jl` in the current environment
    - all `Integer` types in `PackageTests.jl` are become `SafeInteger` types
    - run it and see if there are any problems!

## A Basic Guide

To use safer integers within your computations, where you have been using    
explict digit sequences put them inside the safe integer constructors,    
`SafeInt(11)` or `SafeUInt(0x015A)` and similarly for the bitsize-named versions    
`SafeInt8`, `SafeInt16` .. `SafeInt128` and `SafeUInt8` .. `SafeUInt128`   

Where you had used`Int` or `UInt` now use `SafeInt` or `SafeUInt` and similarly
with the bitsize-named versions.    

SafeInt and SafeUInt give you these arithmetic operators:    
`+`, `-`, `*`, `div`, `rem`, `fld`, `mod`, `fld1`, `mod1`, `^`   
which have become overflow and underflow aware.

The Int and UInt types can fail at simple arithmetic        
and will continue carrying the incorrectness forward.    
The validity of values obtained is difficult to ascertain.

Most calculations proceed without incident, 
and when used SafeInts operate as Ints
should a calculation encouter an overflow or underflow, 
    we are alerted and the calculation does not proceed.

#### Give them a whirl.

> Get the package: `Pkg.add("SaferIntegers")`     
> Use the package:  `using SaferIntegers`     

- These functions check for overflow/underflow automatically:    
    - `abs`, `neg`, `div`, `fld`, `fld1`, `cld`, `rem`, `mod`, `mod1`
    - `divrem`, `fldmod`, `fldmod1`
    - `-`, `+`, `*`, `^`
    - so does `/`, before converting to Float64

## Exported Types and Constructors / Converters

- `SafeInt8`, `SafeInt16`, `SafeInt32`, `SafeInt64`, `SafeInt128`    
- `SafeUInt8`, `SafeUInt16`, `SafeUInt32`, `SafeUInt64`, `SafeUInt128`   
- `SafeSigned`, `SafeUnsigned`, `SafeInteger`
- `SafeRational`

They check for overflow, even when multiplied by the usual Int and UInt types.    
Otherwise, they should be unsurprising.

### Type definitions

```
abstract type SafeUnsigned <: Unsigned end
abstract type SafeSigned <: Signed end
const SafeInteger = Union{SafeUnsigned, SafeSigned}
```

(thanks to Mark Kittisopikul's PR and TimHoly's design of Ratios.jl)

## Other Conversions 

`Signed(x::SafeSigned)` returns an signed integer of the same bitwidth as x    
`Unsigned(x::SafeUnsigned)` returns an unsigned integer of the same bitwidth as x    
`Integer(x::SafeInteger)` returns an Integer of the same bitwidth and either Signed or Unsigned as is x

`SafeSigned(x::Signed)` returns a safe signed integer of the same bitwidth as x    
`SafeUnsigned(x::Unsigned)` returns a safe unsigned integer of the same bitwidth as x    
`SafeInteger(x::Integer)` returns a safe Integer of the same bitwidth and is either Signed or Unsigned as matches x

## Test code for integer safety

### test snippets
```julia

julia> @saferintegers begin
         x = 64
         y = Int16(16)
         z = x + y + SafeInt128(x)
         x, y, z
         end
(64, 16, 144)

julia> typeof.(ans)
(SafeInt64, SafeInt16, SafeInt128)
```

### test source file
```julia
julia> cd(<source file directory>)
julia> @saferintegers include(<filename.jl>)
```

## Benchmarking (on one machine)

julia v1.1-dev
```julia
using SaferIntegers
using BenchmarkTools
BenchmarkTools.DEFAULT_PARAMETERS.time_tolerance=0.005

@noinline function test(n, f, a,b,c,d)
   result = a;
   i = 0
   while true
       i += 1
       i > n && break       
       result += f(d,c)+f(b,a)+f(d,b)+f(c,a)
   end
   return result
end

hundredths(x) = round(x, digits=2)

a = 17; b = 721; c = 75; d = 567;
sa, sb, sc, sd = SafeInt.((a, b, c, d));
n = 10_000;

hundredths( (@belapsed test(n, +, $sa, $sb, $sc, $sd)) /
            (@belapsed test(n, +, $a, $b, $c, $d))        )
1.25

hundredths( (@belapsed test(n, *, $sa, $sb, $sc, $sd)) /
            (@belapsed test(n, *, $a, $b, $c, $d))        )
1.25

hundredths( (@belapsed test(n, div, $sa, $sb, $sc, $sd)) /
            (@belapsed test(n, div, $a, $b, $c, $d))      )
1.14
